# GGCW_toolbox
Toolbox for python that can be used on the Digital Globe GBDX platform

This toolbox was developed during the Digital Globe GBDX for Sustainability Challange.
Global Green City Watch aimed at using Very High Resolution Imagery for the assessment of quality green space in urban environments.
Tools that were developed were used on jupyter notebooks on the GBDX platform but can also be executed on regular Python installations
when the GBDX API is installed.
